# Mage-AI Marvel Project
The Mage-AI Marvel Project is a data processing pipeline that uses Mage-AI to process character data from the Marvel API. \
The processed data is saved in an S3 bucket in Parquet format for further analysis and in a PostgreSQL database.

## Data Sources
The Mage-AI Marvel Project uses data from the Marvel API. \
Access keys can be created by following the Marvel tutorial: https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started

## Pipeline
The data pipeline consists of the following steps:

1.  Connect to the Marvel API using the access keys
2.  Retrieve character data from the API
3.  Process the data using Mage-AI
4.  Save the processed data in an S3 bucket and a PostgreSQL database

A flowchart of the pipeline is shown below:
